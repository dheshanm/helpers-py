# Helper Functions

This repoitory contains various helper functions that I use in my projects. The functions are organized into modules based on their functionality. The modules are:

- `cli`: Functions for command line interfaces.
- `config`: Functions for reading configuration files. i.e. INI files.
- `db`: Functions for working with databases. i.e. PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- `hash`: Functions for hashing data.
- `sheet`: Functions for working with Google Sheets.
- `timer`: Functions for timing code.
- `util`: General utility functions: i.e. logging, config, etc.
